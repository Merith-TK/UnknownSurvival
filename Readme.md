### **Unknown Survival**

***readme generated with aid of chatgpt for prototyping thoughts on gameplay mechanics, no story is planned at this moment***

#### 1. **Core Concept**  
A **strategic VR shooter** set in a dark, desolate world where players must use a mix of **telekinetic powers, physical interactions, and a robust weapon system** to survive. Players explore hostile environments, solving momentum-based puzzles and managing limited resources to stay alive.

#### 2. **Gameplay Mechanics**
- **VRIK Movement**: Players will have full-body immersive movement (VRIK), allowing natural physical actions like walking, crouching, and interacting with the environment.
- **Grapple Hooks, Teleportation, and Telekinesis**: Movement and combat are enhanced with abilities like grappling between structures, teleporting to evade enemies, and using telekinesis to manipulate objects or enemies in real time.
- **Physical Interactions**: The game’s inventory system will have realistic physical interaction, inspired by **Ghosts of Tabor**, where items can be freely manipulated, placed in a bag, and interact with each other. The kit system will follow **Into The Radius**, offering flexibility in gear loadout.
- **Crafting and Repair**: A unique crafting system will focus on repairing weapons and creating basic tools, emphasizing resourcefulness in a hostile world. Melee weapons and other tools will be crafted from scavenged materials.
- **Weapon System**: Realistic and satisfying weapons with a deep focus on handling, reloading, and customization. You aim to build a **good weapon system** where every shot and interaction feels meaningful.

#### 3. **Setting & Atmosphere**
- **Dark Exploration**: Inspired by **Into The Radius**, the world will have a haunting “you’re not supposed to be here” vibe, mixed with moments of breathtaking scenery amidst desolation. The environment will be mostly bleak but with pockets of beauty to contrast the loneliness.
- **Survival**: Players must manage their resources carefully, including weapons, health, and crafting materials. Encounters with enemies will be strategic and tense due to limited ammo and tools.
  
#### 4. **Target Audience**
- **Stalker-Players and Survivalists**: Fans of games like **S.T.A.L.K.E.R., Into The Radius, and Escape From Tarkov** will appreciate the tense survival mechanics, exploration, and strategic combat.
  
#### 5. **Challenges**
- **Momentum Puzzles**: Solving physics-based puzzles involving momentum, grappling, and telekinesis to unlock new areas or escape danger.
- **Limited Resources**: Players will need to conserve ammunition, craft basic tools, and manage their inventory to survive harsh environments.

#### 6. **Unique Selling Points**
- **Grapple Hook and Telekinesis Mechanics**: While many VR shooters focus on gunplay, this game will stand out with **dynamic movement systems** like grapple hooks and **telekinesis powers** to interact with enemies and the environment in creative ways.
- **Realistic Inventory and Crafting**: The **physical interaction system** for inventory management and the focus on tool creation and repair will add depth to the survival experience, requiring more thoughtful planning.



### **Unique Control Mechanics**

#### 1. **Telekinesis System**
   - **Input**: ThumbRest + Grip
   - **Description**: Players can initiate telekinesis by pressing the thumb-rest and grip together, allowing them to manipulate objects in the environment with their mind.

#### 2. **Gravity Grab System**
   - **Input**: ThumbRest + Grip + Trigger + Flick Gesture
   - **Description**: Building on the telekinesis system, players will be able to perform a gravity grab by adding the trigger and a flick of the controller, pulling distant objects toward them in mid-air with a satisfying, fluid motion.

#### 3. **Grapple System**
   - **Input**: ThumbRest + Grip + Trigger + 90-degree Twist
   - **Description**: The grapple system allows players to initiate grappling by combining the thumb-rest, grip, and trigger inputs, along with a 90-degree twist of the controller. This system provides a precise and satisfying way to grapple between surfaces without the need for a flick gesture.
